> Digital gardens focus not on being a definite source of truth, but rather a source which is constantly evolving as your own knowledge grows and changes [source](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought)

This is my digital garden, where I document what I find interesting and aim to learn (efficiently) in the field of AI. I first came across this concept through the cool website [notes on AI](https://notesonai.com/notes+on+ai), and it inspired me to plant my own garden. Now, whenever I dive into a new project requiring deep research, I build this growing collection of notes. Thanks to tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), the process has become incredibly easy.

# Why I Take Notes

- The more effort I invest, [the better things stick.](https://opentext.wsu.edu/ospsychrevisions/chapter/how-memory-functions/#:~:text=Effortful%20processing%20refers%20to%20encoding,a%20test%20requires%20effortful%20processing.)
- Quick reference for my future self.
- Shareable knowledge for others.

# How I Take Notes

I don’t follow a particular notetaking method, but here’s how I simplify complex or lengthy information:

- Break down content into manageable chunks by creating subsections.
- Use ordered lists and bullet points to summarize key points.
- Create new pages for recurring terms or concepts.
- Skim and focus on what's most important.
