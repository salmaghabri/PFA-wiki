The Onera Satellite Change Detection dataset addresses the issue of detecting changes between satellite images from different dates.

It comprises 24 pairs of multispectral images taken from the [Sentinel-2 satellites](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) between 2015 and 2018. Locations are picked all over the world, in Brazil, USA, Europe, Middle-East and Asia. For each location, registered pairs of 13-band multispectral satellite images obtained by the Sentinel-2 satellites are provided. Images vary in spatial resolution between 10m, 20m and 60m.

Pixel-level change ground truth is provided for all 14 training and 10 test image pairs. The annotated changes focus on urban changes, such as new buildings or new roads. These data can be used for training and setting parameters of change detection algorithms.
 - the changes were manually annotated at pixel level. 
 - This dataset was created using the multispectral images taken by the Sentinel-2 satellites of places with different levels of urbanization in several different countries that have experienced urban growth and/or changes.
 - The dataset is focused on urban areas, labelling as Change only urban growth and changes and ignoring natural changes (e.g. vegetation growth or sea tides).
 - The satellite captures images of various resolutions between 10m and 60m in 13 bands between ultraviolet and short wavelength infrared.
 - Twenty-four regions of approximately 600x600 pixels at 10m resolution with various levels of urbanization where urban changes were visible were chosen worldwide.
 - The images of all bands were cropped according to the chosen geographical coordinates, resulting in 26 images for each region, i.e. 13 bands for each of the images in the image pair. These images were downloaded and cropped using the Medusa toolbox


# split train test

On the OSCD dataset, we split the data in train and test groups as recommended by the dataset’s creators: fourteen images were used for training and ten images were used for testing.

# Challenges and limitations
1. **the images generated by the Sentinel-2 satellite are of a relatively low resolution.**: 
		This resolution allows the detection of the appearance of large buildings between the images in the image pair. Smaller changes such as the appearance of small buildings, the extension of existing buildings or the addition of lanes to an existing road, for example, may not be obvious in the images. For this reason, even the change maps that are generated manually by different analysts may differ
2.  the changes contained in the dataset are of a temporal distance of at most two and a half years approximately, and less than that in many cases. This also means that the images contain many times more pixels labelled as no change than labelled as change.
