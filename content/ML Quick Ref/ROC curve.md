- The graph between the True Positive Rate on the y-axis and the False Positive Rate on the x-axis is called the ROC curve and is used in binary classification.
- In order to construct the ROC curve, the TPR and FPR values are plotted on multiple threshold values. The area range under the ROC curve has a range between 0 and 1. A completely random model, which is represented by a straight line, has a 0.5 ROC. The amount of deviation a ROC has from this straight line denotes the efficiency of the model.
