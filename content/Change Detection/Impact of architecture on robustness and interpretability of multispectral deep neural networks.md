# 1. INTRODUCTION

**From an implementation perspective**, the availability of additional spectral bands expands the space of neural network architecture design choices, as there are a plethora of ways one might “fuse” information coming from different input channels.

**From an evaluation perspective**, multispectral imagery provides a new dimension in which to study model robustness
