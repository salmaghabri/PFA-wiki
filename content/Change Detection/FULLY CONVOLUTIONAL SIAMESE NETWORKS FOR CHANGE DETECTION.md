# ABSTRACT
- presents three fully convolutional neural network architectures which perform change detection using a pair of coregistered images
-   two Siamese extensions of fully convolutional networks which use heuristics about the current problem to achieve the best results in our tests on two open change detection datasets, using both RGB and multispectral images.
